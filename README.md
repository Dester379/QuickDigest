# QuickDigest

## Introduction
"QuickDigest" is an innovative application designed to allow users to interact with their documents in a conversational manner. By harnessing the capabilities of AI, QuickDigest can comprehend and respond to user queries by referencing the content of uploaded documents. Whether you're dealing with PDF, TXT, or even audio and video files, our application can process and deliver relevant responses.

## Why We Built Our App

In today's digital age, information is abundant, but the ability to extract meaningful insights from vast amounts of data remains a challenge. We recognized that individuals and businesses alike grapple with sifting through heaps of documents, audio files, and videos to find relevant information. The process is not only time-consuming but often overwhelming, leading to missed opportunities and inefficiencies.

Our app was born out of the need to bridge this gap. We envisioned a tool that could seamlessly integrate with various data formats, be it text, audio, or video, and provide users with precise, context-aware answers to their queries.

## What Are We Solving?

1. Information Overload: With the exponential growth of data, finding specific information in a sea of documents becomes akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Our app addresses this by indexing and making sense of vast amounts of data, ensuring that users get the information they need without the noise.

2. Multimodal Data Integration: In the modern world, data isn't just textual. Audio and video files are equally crucial. Our integration with AssemblyAI ensures that even non-textual data is transcribed, indexed, and made searchable, breaking barriers between different data formats.

3. Instantaneous Responses: Time is of the essence. Waiting for long durations to get answers isn't feasible. QuickDigest is expected to take around 15-20% time to provide answers based on the file size. 

4. Enhanced Productivity: By automating the process of data retrieval and offering context-aware answers, we empower users to focus on decision-making rather than data hunting. This not only boosts productivity but also ensures informed decisions based on comprehensive data insights.
